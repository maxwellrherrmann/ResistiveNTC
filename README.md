# ResistiveNTC
Scripts for calibration of an NTC thermistor obeying the Steinhart-Hart equation as well as continuous readout. Intended for use with CROC SCC testing.

The expected hardware configuration is described here: http://razzpisampler.oreilly.com/ch08.html
The NTC calibration is done according to the Steinhart-Hart model: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steinhart%E2%80%93Hart_equation
